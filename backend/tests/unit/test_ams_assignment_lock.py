"""Regression tests for ``_ams_assignment_locks`` (per-printer serialisation
of ``on_ams_change``'s spool-assignment block).

Background
==========

MQTT bursts can deliver two ``ams_data`` push frames for the same printer ~30
ms apart (observed in the wild: H2D + dual AMS at K-profile load + RFID-read
boundaries). Without serialisation, both ``on_ams_change`` callbacks read
"no assignment for ``(printer, ams, tray)``" in their respective sessions,
both call ``auto_assign_spool``, both ``INSERT``, and the second commit
violates ``spool_assignment_printer_id_ams_id_tray_id_key``:

    asyncpg.exceptions.UniqueViolationError: duplicate key value violates
    unique constraint "spool_assignment_printer_id_ams_id_tray_id_key"
    DETAIL:  Key (printer_id, ams_id, tray_id)=(1, 0, 0) already exists.

SQLite's WAL serialises writes so the bug stayed latent there for ~7 weeks.
It surfaced when optional Postgres support landed and asyncpg started
allowing true concurrent transactions.

These tests assert the lock primitive's properties, not the full
``on_ams_change`` flow — wiring the whole callback through a real DB at unit
scope would dwarf the size of the fix and add no signal beyond what the
existing integration suite already covers.
